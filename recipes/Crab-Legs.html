        <p>An easy crab legs recipe with a garlicky butter sauce that's ready in just 20 minutes! I ended up getting some snow crab legs on sale at the market. I wanted something a little different from plain steamed, boiled, or grilled crab legs, so I ended up throwing a few things together to make this awesome crab leg recipe. This dish would be great with shrimp as well. Enjoy!</p>
